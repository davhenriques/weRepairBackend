open ./src/model/database.js
on databasename type your database name
on password type you database password 

the database needs to be on postgress SQL

run npm start to start the API

if it gives an error creating the tables, run "npm start" to completly create all the tables. 

once started you can run the frontend.



Note:  I don't know if you use postgress, if you don't I used pgadmin to jold my database locally

if there is any trouble deploying the API, I can deploy it to something like heroku.
